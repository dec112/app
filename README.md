# DEC112 Mobile Application

## Configuration

`UserConfiguration` contains all call targets - these needs to be set in order to test an emergency call

`SipConfiguration`contains all sip related configuration items - these needs to be set in order to test an emergency call

## Run development mode

run `npm install` if you are running the app for the fist time
run `ionic serve -l` and a browser window will be opened automatically on port 8200

Note: This only runs the application. For testing the emergency call function you need all components running and the app must be configured properly.
